  title={Convergence to Nash Equilibrium: A Comparative Study of Rock-Paper-Scissors Algorithms},
  author={Geetika Vadali, M Deekshitha Reddy, Ritu Rani, Poonam Bansal},
  abstract={Rock-paper-scissors is one of the most established imperfect information games in Game theory. The Nash Equilibrium of an RPS game is relatively simple but computationally intractable; hence, various algorithms are employed to converge to a state of maximum payoff. In this paper, five algorithms, namely - Counterfactual Regret Minimization, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Q-Iearning, Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization, have been compared on the evaluation metrics of average reward, draw ratio and convergence speed. Throughout the comparative analysis, visualising the learning curves, and qualitative comparison, Q-Iearning has shown the best convergence to Nash equilibrium for RPS.},

title={Predicting Optimal Startup Exit Strategies with Ensemble Learning for Venture Capitalists},
author={Geetika Vadali, M Deekshitha Reddy, Ritu Rani, Arun Sharma, Amita Dev},
abstract={In the current landscape, Venture capitalists are opting for

more data-driven decision-making to achieve high returns while mitigat-
ing risks. All VCs seek a home run in their portfolio, for which it is

essential to select the optimal exit. The process can be smoothed with
the prediction of the type of exit- IPO, M&A, or the next funding round.
Further, also to gauge which type of exit yields maximum profit for the
particular climate. In this paper, through the utilization of six machine

learning models - Elastic Net, SVR, Kernel Ridge, Gradient Boost, XG-
Boost, and Random Forest, trained on factual data sourced from Crunch-
base, we propose an ensemble learning model with Root Mean Square

Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) score of 0.29 and R-squared score (R2) of
0.76. This weight-averaged ensemble has been validated to predict the

optimal exit for a startup under 6 broad labels - IPO, Acquisition, Lever-
aged Buyout, Merger, Acquihire, and Management Buyout.},
