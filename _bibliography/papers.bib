title={Shoulder Rotator Cuff Tear Detection From Ultrasound Videos Using
Deep Reinforcement Learning},
abstract={Rotator cuff tears (RCT) are common musculoskeletal injuries that significantly impact 
patient mobility and quality of life. Ultrasound (US) is a real-time, cost-effective tool for 
diagnosing RCT, offering dynamic assessment through video sweeps. However, these videos are 
noisy and challenging to interpret, even for experts. They are also often quite long and contain 
redundant frames which make it more timeconsuming for clinicians to identify key diagnostic details. 
To address this, we developed a novel RCT assessment technique using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based 
video summarization approach, where the RL-agent mimics a human expert by analyzing the full video, selecting 
diagnostically relevant frames, and then using CNN to classify the frames as intact or torn. The 
innovative reward mechanism, emphasizing the frame dissimilarity and feature similarity, enhances 
the RL agentâ€™s frame selection process. This reduces computational complexity and storage requirements, 
and simplifies the downstream classification task by focusing only on the keyframes indicative of RCTs. 
Experimental results on 100 patients demonstrate that our proposed classification network achieved 85.0% 
accuracy (90.0% sensitivity, 80.0% specificity) using the RL-generated video summary, outperforming full 
video classification accuracy of 82.5%, while also reducing the training time by 50% (from 8 hours to 4 hours)
, highlighting its potential to assist clinicians in more effective diagnosis. The DRL approach developed in 
this work can be integrated into a low-cost US-AI tool that can reliably identify RCTs, thus improving access 
to imaging, providing earlier disease diagnosis and enhancing patient care.},

  title={Convergence to Nash Equilibrium: A Comparative Study of Rock-Paper-Scissors Algorithms},
  author={Geetika Vadali, M Deekshitha Reddy, Ritu Rani, Poonam Bansal},
  abstract={Rock-paper-scissors is one of the most established imperfect information games in Game theory. The Nash Equilibrium of an RPS game is relatively simple but computationally intractable; hence, various algorithms are employed to converge to a state of maximum payoff. In this paper, five algorithms, namely - Counterfactual Regret Minimization, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Q-Iearning, Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization, have been compared on the evaluation metrics of average reward, draw ratio and convergence speed. Throughout the comparative analysis, visualising the learning curves, and qualitative comparison, Q-Iearning has shown the best convergence to Nash equilibrium for RPS.},

title={Predicting Optimal Startup Exit Strategies with Ensemble Learning for Venture Capitalists},
author={Geetika Vadali, M Deekshitha Reddy, Ritu Rani, Arun Sharma, Amita Dev},
abstract={In the current landscape, Venture capitalists are opting for
more data-driven decision-making to achieve high returns while mitigat-
ing risks. All VCs seek a home run in their portfolio, for which it is
essential to select the optimal exit. The process can be smoothed with
the prediction of the type of exit- IPO, M&A, or the next funding round.
Further, also to gauge which type of exit yields maximum profit for the
particular climate. In this paper, through the utilization of six machine
learning models - Elastic Net, SVR, Kernel Ridge, Gradient Boost, XG-
Boost, and Random Forest, trained on factual data sourced from Crunch-
base, we propose an ensemble learning model with Root Mean Square
Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) score of 0.29 and R-squared score (R2) of
0.76. This weight-averaged ensemble has been validated to predict the
optimal exit for a startup under 6 broad labels - IPO, Acquisition, Lever-
aged Buyout, Merger, Acquihire, and Management Buyout.},
