I am a final year undergraduate pursuing Bachelors in Technology in **Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence**.
I am based in **New Delhi**, the capital city of India!

I am a curious and systems-driven individual with proficiency in **AI theory and applications**.

I am pursuing BTech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from IGDTUW. I am interested in AI and ML applications and research. I call myself an avid non-fic reader, a thinker and a problem-solver!

I appreciate quality conversations and love deriving meaning from data and experiences. Find gratification in working optimistically towards a technology-aided utopia. Deep Learning, Natural Language, Neurosciences and Game Theory are some of the spheres of technology I am actively exploring.

Areas of Interest :
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, Game Theory, Natural Language Processing, AI for Healthcare, AI for Sciences, NeuroAI, Computer Vision
